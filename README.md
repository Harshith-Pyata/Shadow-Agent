Abstract:
Shadow Agent is an AI-powered personal computer assistant designed to execute OS-level tasks and remote system control via an intelligent agent interface. It allows users to operate their laptop from anywhere in the world using a secure connection through a web portal or remote access tools. The agent interprets natural language commands, triggers predefined or adaptive tools, and performs complex tasks, such as file operations, application management, and system monitoring


Description:

Title of Invention:
Shadow Agent – AI-Driven Personal Computer Assistant for Remote System Control and OS-Level Task Automation

Field of the Invention:
The present invention relates to artificial intelligence and computer automation systems, more specifically to an AI-driven personal computer assistant capable of performing OS-level tasks and remote system control using intelligent agent-based architecture. The invention enables users to operate and manage their personal computers from any location in the world via secure communication channels and natural language instructions.

Background of the Invention:
With the increasing reliance on computers for personal and professional use, the need for efficient, secure, and intelligent remote system management has become critical. Existing remote access tools often require complex setup, lack contextual understanding, or are limited to manual user interactions.
Additionally, current automation frameworks demand technical expertise and do not offer conversational, adaptive control.

There exists a need for a system that:

	Understands natural language commands.
	Executes OS-level operations autonomously.
	Operates securely from any global location.
	Integrates multiple tools and services dynamically.

The invention provides an AI-driven agent, referred to as Shadow Agent, which enables users to control and manage a personal computer from anywhere in the world. The Shadow Agent uses an intelligent agent-based architecture to interpret user instructions (via text or voice), map them to predefined or dynamically generated workflows, and execute them at the operating system level.
The invention supports secure access via encrypted remote connections and allows control through either a dedicated web portal or compatible remote interfaces.

Detailed Description of the Invention
1. Architecture
	The Shadow Agent system comprises:
	Command Interface Layer: Accepts user instructions via  mobile app, or API endpoint.
	Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine: Parses and interprets commands to determine intent and parameters.
	Agent Core: Decision-making component that selects and invokes the correct tool or workflow.
	Tool Executor Module: Executes OS-level operations such as file handling, application control, network configuration, and process 	management.
	Security & Authentication Module: Manages encryption, user authentication, and secure data transfer.
	Learning & Adaptation Module: Improves accuracy and efficiency through historical interaction analysis.

2. Modes of Operation
	Remote Web Access – The user logs into a secure web interface from anywhere in the world to issue commands to the Shadow Agent.
	API-Based Control – External systems or scripts can send structured commands to the agent for execution.
	Voice Command Execution – The agent accepts voice input, processes it via speech-to-text, and executes relevant tasks.
	Scheduled and Event-Triggered Automation – The agent can execute workflows automatically based on time schedules or system events.

3. Security Features
	End-to-end encryption.
	Two-factor authentication for user access.
	IP whitelisting and session control.
	Encrypted logs to ensure activity integrity.

4. Example Use Cases
	Remote file retrieval or deletion.
	Launching, stopping, or managing applications.
	System monitoring and generating performance reports.
	Executing scripts or installing software remotely.
	Managing network configurations.

5. Advantages of the Invention
	Operates from any location globally without physical access to the target computer.
	Reduces technical barriers for remote operations by allowing natural language instructions.
	Adapts to multiple operating systems.
	Ensures secure and reliable execution.

Claims:
1. A system for remotely operating and managing a personal computer, comprising:
	a user interface layer configured to receive natural language input from a remote user,
	a natural language understanding module configured to interpret said input and determine an intended action,
	a tool invocation layer configured to select one or more OS-level tools or automation workflows based on the interpreted action,
	an execution layer configured to perform said action locally on the personal computer, and
	a secure communication channel configured to transmit and receive data between the personal computer and the remote user,
2. The natural language input comprises text-based commands.
3. The natural language input comprises voice-based commands.
4. The secure communication channel uses end-to-end encryption to ensure privacy and data integrity.
5. The tool invocation layer is configured to:
	launch applications,
	manage files,
	configure system settings,
	automate workflows, and
	retrieve data from local or online sources.
6. The natural language understanding module is capable of context-aware multi-turn dialogue to refine task execution.
7. The system is operable across multiple operating systems and can integrate additional tools or APIs for extended functionalities.
8. The Shadow Agent operates as an intelligent intermediary to perform OS-level tasks without requiring constant user supervision.
